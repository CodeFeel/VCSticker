self.view.addSubview(label)
```

let image = VCImageSticker(frame: CGRect(x: 20, y: 40, width: 200, height: 200))
image.imageView.image = UIImage(named: "test")
self.view.addSubview(image)
```
Other variables
```Swift
sticker.textColor   = UIColor.red             // text color
sticker.borderColor = UIColor.red             // border color
sticker.closeBtnEnable  = true                // show close button or not
sticker.resizeBtnEnable = true                // show resize button or not
sticker.restrictionEnable = true              // resticts movements in superview bounds or not
sticker.onBeginEditing = {
    // block when the label is activated
}
